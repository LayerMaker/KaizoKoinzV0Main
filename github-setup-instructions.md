# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to create a GitHub repository and push your local code to it:

## 1. Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in with your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter "KaizoKoinzV0Main" as the repository name
4. Add a description (optional): "A retro gaming platform with SNES emulation and cryptocurrency wallet integration"
5. Select "Private" for repository visibility
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these locally)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to connect your existing repository. Use the following commands:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/LayerMaker/KaizoKoinzV0Main.git

# Push your local repository to GitHub
git push -u origin master

# Push your tags to GitHub
git push origin --tags
```

Replace `LayerMaker` with your GitHub username if different.

## 3. Verify the Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files and the "save-state1" tag
3. Click on the "Tags" link to view your save states

## 4. Future Workflow

For future development:

1. Create a new branch for each feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/gamepad-calibration
   ```

2. Make changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implemented gamepad calibration"
   ```

3. Push the branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/gamepad-calibration
   ```

4. When the feature is complete, merge it to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge feature/gamepad-calibration
   ```

5. Create a new save state tag if this is a major milestone:
   ```bash
   git tag -a "save-state2-feature-description" -m "Save state 2: Description of what works"
   git push origin "save-state2-feature-description"
   ```

Remember to always test thoroughly before creating a new save state!
