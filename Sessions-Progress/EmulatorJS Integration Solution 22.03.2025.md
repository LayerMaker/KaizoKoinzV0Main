EmulatorJS Integration Solution
I've successfully integrated the EmulatorJS emulator into the React application by implementing an iframe-based approach. This solution maintains all security requirements while ensuring the emulator works correctly.

Problem Identified
The original implementation had issues with script loading order and initialization sequence, causing 403 errors and preventing the emulator from loading properly in the React component. While the standalone emulator.html file worked correctly, the React component version did not.

Solution Implemented
I modified the emulator-section.tsx component to:

Use an iframe to embed the working emulator.html file
Set proper sandbox attributes for security
Handle loading and error states appropriately
Maintain all the original styling and UI elements
This approach has several advantages:

Leverages the already working standalone implementation
Maintains security by using the same secure API endpoints for ROM loading
Preserves all functionality including gamepad support and save states
Follows the security guidelines in the main system prompt
Key Changes
Replaced the direct EmulatorJS initialization with an iframe embedding
Added proper event handlers for iframe loading and errors
Kept the original global EmulatorJS configuration for potential future use
Maintained the same secure ROM loading mechanism through the API
Security Considerations
The implementation maintains all security requirements:

ROMs are still loaded from the secure API endpoint
Users cannot upload or modify their own ROMs
The ROM loading process remains secure and tamper-proof
All API endpoints have proper CORS headers
Result
The emulator now loads and runs correctly within the React application. The game (Invictus) loads properly, and all functionality is preserved, including:

ROM loading from the secure API
Save state functionality
Gamepad support
UI integration with the rest of the application
You can now continue developing other aspects of the application with confidence that the emulator integration is working correctly.
