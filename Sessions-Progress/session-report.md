EmulatorJS Integration Issue Resolution
I've successfully fixed the issue with the EmulatorJS integration in the Kaizo Koinz web3 gaming platform. The ROM now loads correctly when accessed directly through the emulator.html page.

Issues Identified and Fixed
API Route Configuration: Enhanced both /api and /app/api routes with:

Detailed logging to track request flow
Proper CORS headers to ensure iframe access
Content-Length headers for proper file transfer
OPTIONS handler for CORS preflight requests
Emulator HTML Configuration: Improved the standalone emulator HTML with:

Additional debug logging
Event listeners for parent window communication
Better error handling and reporting
React Component Integration: Enhanced the iframe integration with:

Improved message passing between parent and iframe
Better loading state management
More robust error handling
Iframe reload functionality
Key Findings
The core issue was resolved by ensuring proper communication between the iframe and the parent window, and by adding appropriate CORS headers to the API routes. The ROM file is now successfully loaded and the game starts correctly when accessed directly through the emulator.html page.

When accessed directly, the emulator successfully:

Shows the "START GAME" button
Loads the ROM file when the button is clicked
Displays the game (INVICTUS title screen)
Next Steps
While the direct emulator access is now working correctly, there may still be some issues with the integration in the React component. To fully resolve all issues:

Ensure the React component is correctly handling messages from the iframe
Verify that the loading state is properly managed in the React component
Test the emulator in different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility
The changes made provide a solid foundation for further refinement of the emulator integration.

## Emulator Controls Positioning Fix (Updated)

I've successfully fixed the issue with the emulator controls positioning in the EmulatorJS integration. The controls now stay properly contained within the emulator container rather than appearing at the bottom of the page, allowing for additional content to be displayed below the emulator.

### Issues Identified and Fixed

**Emulator HTML Structure and CSS:**
- Created a proper page layout with fixed-width container for the emulator
- Added a responsive container with proper aspect ratio for the game
- Added custom CSS to ensure the controls stay within the container boundaries
- Applied `!important` to key CSS properties to override any conflicting styles from the EmulatorJS library
- Added box-sizing rules to prevent overflow issues

### Implementation Details

1. Created a backup of the working emulator.html file for safety
2. Modified the emulator.html file with:
   - Added a page container with max-width and centered layout
   - Added an emulator wrapper with border and shadow for visual separation
   - Created a container div with proper positioning context and aspect ratio
   - Added custom CSS to control the positioning of all EmulatorJS elements
   - Added placeholder for content that would appear below the emulator
3. Created a test version (emulator-test-fixed.html) with debug information to verify the changes
4. Tested both the original and test versions to confirm the fix works correctly

### Key Findings

The core issue was that the EmulatorJS controls were using `position: absolute; bottom: 0;` without a proper positioning context, causing them to be positioned relative to the viewport rather than the emulator container. Additionally, the emulator was taking up the full width and height of the page, preventing any content from being displayed below it.

Our solution addresses both issues by:
1. Creating a fixed-width container for the emulator that doesn't take up the full page
2. Establishing a proper positioning context for the controls
3. Adding specific CSS rules to ensure all EmulatorJS elements stay within their container
4. Providing space for additional content below the emulator

### Next Steps

- Test the emulator in different screen sizes to ensure the controls remain properly positioned
- Verify that the controls work correctly on mobile devices
- Ensure the fix doesn't interfere with other aspects of the emulator functionality
- Integrate the emulator container with the rest of the page design
