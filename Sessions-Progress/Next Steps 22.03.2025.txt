Next Steps:
Examine network requests more closely - We need to pinpoint exactly which resources are returning 403 errors when loaded from the main app

Check for initialization differences - The standalone HTML file might initialize differently than the React component

Component Isolation - We could create a simpler version of the emulator component and test it incrementally

Script Loading Order - The React component might have issues with the order of script loading compared to the standalone HTML file

Consider a fallback approach - If we can't resolve the integration issues quickly, we could use an iframe to embed the working emulator.html directly into the React application
